# Ubuntu Server to Desktop

I started with a base server ISO of Ubuntu 24.04 and used Ansible to configure it into a usable desktop environment. This is my first full playbook so it might be gross, but it *DOES* fully work.

## What's it do?

This playbook has multiple roles (mostly tagged, but I'll update it as I go) that you can decide on which you want to run in the ```site.yml``` before you get going.

This playbook was built for me to install my new desktop environment so it may need tweaking for your tastes. 

## Adding dotfiles
